        "Description": "Friedrich Vorwerk Group SE provides various solutions for transformation and transportation of energy in Germany and Europe. It operates through four segments: Natural Gas, Electricity, Clean Hydrogen, and Adjacent Opportunities. The Natural Gas segment comprises infrastructure services and product solutions for the transport and conversion of raw natural gas into treated natural gas; and engages in transporting the natural gas through high-pressure pipelines to processing in filtering and separation plants, compressor stations, storage and measurement systems, LNG terminals, and gas pressure control and measurement systems. The Electricity segment provides infrastructure for the underground transport and conversion of electricity that is generated from non-fossil energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydro, and renewable resources. This segment is involved in landing offshore electricity and installing high-voltage underground cables through which electricity is transported to transmission networks. The Clean Hydrogen segment provides product solutions and infrastructure services for the conversion of energy from energy sources into hydrogen, and its transportation to consumers, which is done through conversion of renewable energy by electrolysis; and processing and transportation of the clean hydrogen produced through storage systems, compressor stations, pipelines, and gas pressure control and measurement systems. The Adjacent Opportunities segment provides technologies, such as the treatment and cleaning of biogenic and synthetic gases; heat extraction technologies used in district heating; solutions for the transportation of drinking and wastewater; and specialty solutions for the chemical and petrochemical industry. Friedrich Vorwerk Group SE was founded in 1962 and is headquartered in Tostedt, Germany.",
