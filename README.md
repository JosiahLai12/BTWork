# BT Internship Exerience Work

Hi to anyone coming across this repository!

I created this repository to manage and store the work I have done including housing all of the data I managed to scrape over a couple of weeks.

This repository houses the product of combining Fundamental Data from https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/stock-etfs-fundamental-data-feeds/ and organising it to combine basic Stock and Exchange information with GICS code for the stock. 

The 'exchanges' folder holds all of the csv files with the lists of stocks in each available exchange. The 'stocks' folder holds the original fundamental data for every stock listed in 'exchanges'.
