This repository houses the product of combining Fundamental Data from https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/stock-etfs-fundamental-data-feeds/ and organising it to combine basic Stock and Exchange information with GICS code for the stock. 

The 'exchanges' folder holds all of the csv files with the lists of stocks in each available exchange. The 'stocks' folder holds the original fundamental data for every stock listed in 'exchanges'.
